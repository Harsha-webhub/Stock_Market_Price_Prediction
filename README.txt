All the directories mentioned below are in directory "code".

Files in directory linear_reg :
	1) Datasets
	2) Python Code(linear_reg.py) for linear regression in which we considered 30 features, you can uncomment some parts to code to get the plots for train,test,validation sets, moreover 	company name of dataset is to be given in the start through terminal.

Files in directory LSTM_vs_GRU :
	1) Notebook(lstm_and_gru.ipynb) each cell in it is used  for specific functionality(for splitting data, normalizing data, training model etc) and this only goes for a single dataset.
	2) Python code(generate_plots.py) - used this to get all the plots(for every dataset) to compare the prediction and original values of test and training dataset. For each dataset separate 	subdirectories are created and plots corresponding to the given dataset are stored in it.

Files in directory LSTM_final :
	1) Python code (main.py) in which a multi stack LSTM model is implemented and  it requires to edit the  company name in the code before running(set to AAPL by default), after running 	completely it prints the 	predicted stock price for next day of the given company.
